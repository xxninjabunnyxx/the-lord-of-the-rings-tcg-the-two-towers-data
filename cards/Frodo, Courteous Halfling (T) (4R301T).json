{"title":"Frodo, Courteous Halfling (T) (4R301T)","text":"Set:\tThe Two Towers\nKind:\tFree People\nCulture:\tShire\nTwilight:\t0\nCard Type:\tCompanion • Hobbit\nStrength:\t3\nVitality:\t4\nResistance:\t10\nSignet:\tFrodo\nGame Text:\tRing-bearer (resistance 10). While you can spot 3 unbound companions, Shadow cards may not discard cards from your hand or from the top of your draw deck.\nLore:\t”'But as for us, we are Hobbits of the Shire, far to the North and West, beyond many rivers.'”\nRarity:\tR\nNotes:\tTengwar. This card only prevents Shadow cards that make you discard from hand or draw deck. If a Shadow card gives you a choice, you may choose to discard. For example: if a Dunlending Rampager is played, Courteous Halfling does not prevent the Free Peoples player from discarding. Since the game text of the Rampager says “may discard, ” a choice is provided.","scanUrl":"https://lotrtcgwiki.com/wiki/_media/cards:lotr04301t.jpg"}
